# Lean Canvas App

The Lean canvas is one of business model canvases especially for start-up, that describes your business in one sheet. For more details, see "RUNNING LEAN" by Ash Maurya from O'Reilly.

This app is a canvas template by html. You don't need to use spreadsheet anymore. All boxes are editable. You can create your own canvas from your browser. Author name will be stored on your localStorage. Other text will be cleared when you refresh your browser. Be carefull!
Once you finished your canvas, print as PDF. That's all.

Well, this app can work on your local. Just download and open index.html.

Enjoy your business modeling. ^^

## note

I created this for my practicing of flexbox, cssgrid and sass. The layout of the Lean Canvas is a good sample for cssgrid/flexbox, don't you think? I'm a very beginner of front end web development. Playing with new toy like a kid. haha
I might publish this somewhere someday. maybe
